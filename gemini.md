# Gemini Project Understanding

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning system for the classification of red blood cell holograms to detect Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). The system aims to distinguish between healthy cells and cells affected by SCD based on their holographic images.

## Core Components

The project is structured into a series of Python scripts and supporting files:

-   **`dataset/`**: This directory contains the raw image data, organized into two subdirectories: `SCD` for sickle cells and `Healthy` for normal cells.

-   **`exploratory_analysis.py`**: This script performs an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the raw dataset. It generates various visualizations and a statistical report (`dataset_analysis_report.txt`) to provide insights into the data's characteristics, such as class distribution, image resolution, and pixel intensity distributions.

-   **`preprocessing_pipeline.py`**: This script is central to the project. It implements a sophisticated preprocessing pipeline tailored for holographic images. The key steps include:
    1.  **Smart Resizing**: Resizes images while preserving their aspect ratio.
    2.  **Hologram Enhancement**: Applies specialized filters (Gaussian and FFT-based) to enhance the interference patterns characteristic of holograms.
    3.  **Normalization**: Normalizes pixel values to a consistent range.
    4.  **Adaptive Contrast Enhancement**: Uses CLAHE to improve local contrast.
    The script processes the raw images, splits them into training and testing sets, and saves the result into a compressed NumPy file named `preprocessed_dataset.npz`. It also generates comparison images and a configuration file.

-   **`hologram_classifier_cv_only.py`**: This script takes the preprocessed data from `preprocessed_dataset.npz` and uses it to train and evaluate several classical machine learning models. It employs repeated stratified cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation. The models tested include Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The script outputs a detailed performance comparison and saves the evaluation results to `cv_only_results.npz`.

-   **`requirements.txt`**: This file lists all the necessary Python libraries for the project, including `scikit-learn`, `opencv-python`, `torch`, and `tensorflow`.



## Execution Workflow

The project follows a clear, sequential workflow:

1.  **Exploratory Analysis (Optional)**: To begin, one can run the `exploratory_analysis.py` script to gain a deeper understanding of the raw image data.

    ```bash
    python exploratory_analysis.py
    ```

2.  **Preprocessing**: The next step is to execute the `preprocessing_pipeline.py` script. This processes the raw images from the `dataset/` directory and generates the `preprocessed_dataset.npz` file, which is essential for the next stage.

    ```bash
    python preprocessing_pipeline.py
    ```

3.  **Model Training and Evaluation**: With the preprocessed data available, the `hologram_classifier_cv_only.py` script can be run. This script trains various models and performs a comprehensive evaluation using cross-validation.

    ```bash
    python hologram_classifier_cv_only.py
    ```

## Summary of Findings

-   The project is well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns between data analysis, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
-   The preprocessing pipeline is thoughtfully designed, incorporating domain-specific techniques for hologram enhancement.
-   The model evaluation is robust, using repeated stratified cross-validation to mitigate the effects of a relatively small dataset.
-   The `rf_tiny` (a small Random Forest model) was identified as the best-performing model in the cross-validation analysis, achieving a high AUC score with low overfitting.
-   The `todo.md` file indicates future plans to deploy the trained model via a REST API, which would complete the end-to-end system for SCD detection.
